Alignment-Based Learning
========================

Alignment-Based Learning (ABL) is a symbolic grammar inference
framework that has succesfully been applied for several unsupervised
machine learning tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP).  

Given sequences of symbols only, a system that implements ABL induces
structure by aligning and comparing the input sequences. As a result,
the input sequences are augmented with the induced structure.  For more
information, see the reference list at the end of this file.

This package contains a C++ implementation of ABL:
* Developed by [Menno van Zaanen](http://ilk.uvt.nl/~menno/) and [Jeroen Geertzen](https://nlp-ml.io/jg/)
* Maintained by Menno, who distributes stable releases including documentation [here](http://ilk.uvt.nl/~menno/research/software/abl)
* A brief explanation and an online demo that can be played with can be found [here](https://nlp-ml.io/jg/software/abl/)

This repository contains a development version and may differ from the latest stable release.
