================================================================================

Alignment-Based Learning (ABL) is a symbolic grammar inference
framework that has succesfully been applied for several unsupervised
machine learning tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP).  Given
sequences of symbols only, a system that implements ABL induces
structure by aligning and comparing the input sequences.  As a result,
the input sequences are augmented with the induced structure.  For more
information, see the reference list at the end of this file.

This package contains a C++ implementation of ABL.  It is maintained
by:

   Menno van Zaanen (mvzaanen@uvt.nl)
