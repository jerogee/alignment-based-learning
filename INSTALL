BASIC INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest way to compile this package is:

1. Being in the same location as this file, type:

      ./configure

   to configure the package for your system.

2. To compile the package, type:

      make

3. To install the programs, the data files and documentation, type:

      make install

4. If desired, you can remove the program binaries and object files
   from the source code directory by typing `make clean'.

After installation, three commands have been made accessible:
- abl_align    : alignment learning
- abl_cluster  : clustering of alignment learning hypotheses
- abl_select   : selection learning

Look into the reference manual in the doc/ directory or in the info
pages for instructions on how to use these commands.

COMPILER OPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before running `make', you might want to take advantage of
machine-specific characteristics in the compilation to increase
program execution speed.  In order to do so, you should set GCCFLAGS
to provide any compilation flags you need for your machine.

E.g. for Pentium4 machines:

   export GCCFLAGS="-march=pentium4 -mfpmath=sse -msse2 -mmmx"

and for AMD Opterons:

   export GCCFLAGS="-march=opteron"
